# Anglicisms-In-French
A list of words that are taken directly from English that are used in French. This is a collection of the words that I have come across. 




####  TikTok pre-emptive damage limitation

With more and more news of possible banning of TikTok I have decided to try and make sure that even if that happens this resource is still viable as a reference. Therefore the tiktoks that are on the list (Up to date as of 3/8/20) are all downloaded and saved in a shared Google Photos album which is avaliable here:

Some were not be accessible as they have been deleted or made private by the user, please let me know about these. This now presents a challenge as the anglicisms list refers to TikToks links. This is fine for now but will become troublesome if TikTok is shut down. The videos saved in the Google Photos album are titled by their video ID. The video ID is found within the desktop link. For example in the link 	https://www.tiktok.com/@alicemoitie/video/6820891822462602501, the video ID is 6820891822462602501. Download the Google Photos album and search for this file name and you will find the appropriate video. However, many of the TikTok links are mobile links, which look like this: https://vm.tiktok.com/cua7TL/. We cannot find the video ID from this. Therefore I have created a very quick and rudimentary tool to convert TikTok mobile links to desktop ones. This is avaliable with instructions here: https://github.com/JackMcKechnie/TikTok-Mobile-To-Desktop-Link-Convertor. It can take multiple links at a time. Whilst I appreciate that this is not the optimal soloution it should work.
